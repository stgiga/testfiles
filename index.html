  <div class="logo">stgiga's Test Files</div>
  
  <h1><b>Welcome!</b></h1>
  
  <p>To begin, I will say that this page is designed to be a unified place for where test files I have made over the years in various technology sectors live. They can help you squash errors in whatever you do.</p>
  <p>If any of these break, it means that there is something wrong with your infrastructure. It's important to note that more than a few of these test files ended up being useful as tests unintentionally.</p>
  <p>Basically, what <i>that</i> means is that the relevant content of mine went <b>so</b> all-out that things go wrong when certain environments try to comprehend them, with varying degrees of severity.</p>
  <p>And then you have files that are great benchmarks or litmus tests of quality and/or rarer features, or things that push the limits of what can be done, or seem outright impossible to do or encounter.</p>
  <p>As for <i>intentional</i> tests, those DO exist, and are counted. Now that we have that out of the way, I should begin the list.</p>

<h3><b>Test File Rationale:</b></h3>
<p>UnifontEX is a libre font fast approaching 2^16 glyphs, and this has confused quite a few programs, especially due to higher-Plane characters, including all sorts of technical and other symbols, including ones useful for debugging.</p>

<h1>The JummBox SoundFont:</h1>
<h3>Test File Rationale:</h3>
<p>This CC-BY-SA4(+GPL3) SoundFont is <i>just</i> under a prevalent artificial, unneeded size cutoff for SoundFonts in some programs, and by a tiny margin, yet it makes a GREAT Silicon SoundFont (Section 11 of the SoundFont standard).</p>

<h1>8K UHD Galaxy Brain Wallpaper:</h1>

<h3>Test File Rationale:</h3>
<p>This image is GREAT for testing image compression algorithms due to how vibrant, detailed, and large it is.</p>
<p>Part of it includes <a href="https://stgiga.github.io/mewbust.stl">this</a> 3D model which is a challenging model to 3D print, but can ONLY be made physical via it.</p>
<p>It also includes the Flashpoint Archive icon of <a href="https://stopdelaying.com/demoscene/nanoscopic.svgz">this:</a></p>
<p>This is a carefully-GZipped SVG that in actuality is an HTML5 browser fidget toy AND a superset of a Chrome Experiment.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this is ALSO a great test image, as is <a href="https://stgiga.github.io/stgiga5.xface">this:</a>
<img src="https://stgiga.github.io/LushFace.gif"> <br>
This is an X-Face, X-Face-el X-Face-Xmas 8bpp grayscale X-Face, Face: header (incidentally using the rare PNG 2bpp Indexed Color mode for space reasons), <br> a Datula animated beyond-3bpp (12 bits but 24 is the format limit which I didn't remotely hit and wouldn't fit in Datula's custom header sending box) RGB animated X-Face, <br> and an X-Face-el X-Face-Xmas 96x48 ("multi") 3bpp RGB animated X-Face,  all with my art.</p>
<br><p>As you can imagine, shoving ALL that into a .xface or .face file is something that wouldn't be expected but isn't against the rules given people really did send X-Face-Xmas X-Faces and Datula X-Faces around, and those use more than one X-Face header. <br>
  And of course inputting multiple headers manually would hurt. Ideally a decoder would do this grid layout given everything is 48x48 (generating the beyond-48x48 stuff is its own can of worms, but I did it).
<br> Also, X-Face in an e-mail would and did GREATLY identify senders. Now that pixel is cool again, why <i>shouldn't</i> we bring them back?</p>
